Project Title: Vendor Performance Data Analysis (End-to-End)
🎯 Objective
In the wholesale and retail industry, effective inventory and sales management is crucial for profitability. Companies like Amazon rely on a network of vendors, and poor vendor performance can lead to:
•	Inefficient pricing strategies
•	Inventory pile-up and high holding costs
•	Missed revenue opportunities
This project aimed to analyze vendor performance using historical data to help the business:
•	Identify underperforming brands needing promotional or pricing adjustments
•	Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit
•	Analyze bulk purchasing impact on unit cost
•	Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs
•	Investigate profitability variance between high- and low-performing vendors

🗂️ Step 1: Data Aggregation & ETL (SQL)
•	Explored multiple database tables to extract relevant columns tied to vendor transactions, pricing, inventory, and sales.
•	Cleaned and merged data to create a final aggregated table.
•	Designed an ETL pipeline to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading back into the database for scheduled refreshes.
💡 Real-world relevance: Mimics enterprise data workflows where fragmented data must be unified for analysis.
🧪 Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
•	Imported the final dataset into Jupyter Notebook.
•	Performed EDA using Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries.
🔍 Insight-driven: Focused on uncovering actionable insights to improve vendor relationships and operational efficiency.
📊 Step 3: Dashboarding & Storytelling (Power BI)
•	Translated Python insights into a dynamic Power BI dashboard.
•	Visualized:
o	Vendor-wise sales and profit trends
o	Inventory turnover metrics
o	Bulk purchase cost analysis
o	High vs. low performing vendor comparison
📈 Business impact: Enabled stakeholders to make data-driven decisions on vendor selection, pricing strategies, and inventory management.
🚀 Final Takeaways
•	Demonstrated end-to-end proficiency in SQL (data engineering), Python (data analysis), and Power BI (business intelligence).
•	Solved a real-world business problem with measurable impact.
•	Built a scalable, automated solution that reflects enterprise-level data practices.
