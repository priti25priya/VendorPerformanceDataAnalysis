# Vendor Performance Data Analysis (End-to-End)

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
In the wholesale and retail industry, effective inventory and sales management is crucial for profitability.  
Poor vendor performance can lead to:  
- Inefficient pricing strategies  
- Inventory pile-up and high holding costs  
- Missed revenue opportunities  

**This project aimed to analyze vendor performance using historical data to help the business:**  
- Identify underperforming brands needing promotional or pricing adjustments  
- Determine top vendors contributing to sales and gross profit  
- Analyze bulk purchasing impact on unit cost  
- Assess inventory turnover to reduce holding costs  
- Investigate profitability variance between high- and low-performing vendors

## ðŸ“‚ Step 1: Data Aggregation & ETL (SQL)
- Explored multiple database tables to extract relevant columns tied to vendor transactions, pricing, inventory, and sales  
- Cleaned and merged data to create a final aggregated table  
- Designed an ETL pipeline to automate data extraction, transformation, and loading back into the database for scheduled refreshes  
- **Real-world relevance:** Mimics enterprise data workflows where fragmented data must be unified for analysis  

## ðŸ§ª Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Imported the final dataset into Jupyter Notebook  
- Performed EDA using Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries  
- **Insight-driven:** Focused on uncovering actionable insights to improve vendor relationships and operational efficiency  

## ðŸ“Š Step 3: Dashboarding & Storytelling (Power BI)
- Translated Python insights into a dynamic Power BI dashboard  
- Visualized:  
  - Vendor-wise sales and profit trends  
  - Inventory turnover metrics  
  - Bulk purchase cost analysis  
  - High vs. low performing vendor comparison
